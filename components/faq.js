        <h4>What if I have never coded before? Can I still come?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes! Blossom is beginner-friendly, and weâ€™ll be holding workshops to
          get you started building your first coding projects.

        <h4>Hackathon? What's that?</h4>
        <p>
          A hackathon is a <span>social coding event</span> -- you get a full
          day, mentors and workshops, and lots of food and swag to build
          anything you want. Even if you've never written a line of code before,
          we'd love to have you there!
