              <h3>Circuit Board Design w/ OnBoard</h3>
              <p>
                In this workshop, participants will learn the fundamentals of
                circuit board design with Hack Club's OnBoard program. Theyâ€™ll
                use EasyEDA, a free circuit design software, to complete this.
                With this track, attendees will learn to use that software as
                well as the basics of PCB design. As a bonus, after students
                complete this track, theyâ€™ll be shipped their PCB to have a
                physical copy of their creation!

              <h3>computer-generated art w/ blot</h3>
              <p>
                In this workshop, participants will learn to create
                computer-generated art by drawing a flower (or squares or a
                tree). Theyâ€™ll use Blot, a robotic arm created by Hack Club that
                translates code to creation. With this track, attendees will
                learn JavaScript and digital fabrication. After students
                complete this track, theyâ€™ll be shipped their own robot arm to
                draw out their creation!
